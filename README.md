## Learning Goals:

Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
	-DRY JavaScript
	-event delegation to handle similar event listeners

Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.

Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops.

Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge.

## Challenges & Wins

This project was a big challenge considering it tied together so many topics I've learned over the last 6 weeks. There was a lot to cover and it's easy to get lost in the sauce but I kept focus by solving one element of the game at a time. When the current atomic element was built or debugged then I moved on the the next element and eventually all the little pieces added up into a whole project. 

This project showed me how much I've learned over the last 6 weeks and I'm really greatful for that.
